- Duplicated information regarding information about who has died from multiple sources (NGOs)
- Messy overlapping datasets with errors
- String data (names) as identifiers
]

 >  Historically, these numbers matter... because they can have a direct impact on policy, accountability and a global sense of urgency.
 
 **Goal:** We want to count the (population) of casualties and *quantify the uncertainty* in this estimate.

# General terminology

![](figure/overall_process.png)

* *Record linkage* is merging together multiple datasets that have duplicate entries (often in the absence of a unique identifier). 

* A *downstream task* is inference, prediction, or post-linkage analysis on the linked data. 
  - Examples: regression, clustering, small area estimation, sample size estimation, population size estimation, etc.

* *Capture-recapture (CRC)* is a method used to estimate a closed population's size through the use of mark-release-recapture.

# Proposed work

* Much work has focused on sample size estimation as the downstream task [TODO: cite]
  - Limited work on population size estimation post-linkage [TODO: cite]

* We look at a general fully Bayesian approach, in the context of the downstream task

* Provide framework for record linkage and CRC, where we crucially account for the record linkage and model uncertainty
