# Introduction

## Prior work

# Bayesian Record Linkage

## Notation

## Generalized Model

## Empirically Motivated Priors

# Post-linkage Analysis

## General Class of Model

## Application: Population Estimation

# Experiments

On all datasets, pair results from each record linkage method with each CRC method.

Potential additions: blocking, bootstrap?


## Data sets

- NLTCS
- cora
- cd
- voter

## Record linkage methods

- unsupervised: Fellegi-Sunter, blink, fastLink, Sadinle
- supervised: logistic regression, random forests, svm, tree, adaboost, bagging, nnet, bumping 

# Capture-recapture methods

- Johndrow
- Bayesian model averaging (Madigan and York (1997))
